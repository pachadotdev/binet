\title{Balassa Index}
\usage{
balassa_index(data, source = "source", target = "target",
  value = "value", discrete = TRUE, cutoff = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(Type: data.frame) a demo datasets such as \code{trade}
or \code{omim} from this package or any arrangement with a bipartite
relation.}

\item{source}{(Type: character) the column with the elements of set X.
By default this is set to \code{"source"}.}

\item{target}{(Type: character) the column with the elements of set Y.
By default this is set to \code{"target"}.}

\item{value}{(Type: character) the column with the binary expression for the
Balassa Index.
By default this is set to \code{"value"}.}

\item{discrete}{(Type: logical) whether converting the Balassa Index to
discrete (0/1) values. Anything below the specified cutoff is converted to 0
and 1 otherwise. By default this is set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cutoff}{(Type: numeric) the cutoff to use for discretization.
By default this is set to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the Balassa Index.
}
\description{
\code{balassa_index()} computes the Balassa Index for a
bipartite relation between two disjoint sets X, the "source" or "from" side,
and Y, the "target" or "to" side.
}
\details{
The current implementation follows
\insertCite{measuringcomplexity2015}{binet} to obtain a metric for
specialisation. In the context of international trade, if the Balassa Index
for a country-product pair is more than 1, it means that country is
specialized in that product.
