\usage{
projections(proximity_source, proximity_target, source = "source",
  target = "target", value = "value", avg_links = 4,
  tolerance = 0.05, compute = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{proximity_source}{a data frame containing proximity
values for the elements of set X (e.g. proximity_source from \code{proximity()})}

\item{proximity_target}{a data frame containing proximity
values for the elements of set Y (e.g. proximity_target from \code{proximity()})}

\item{source}{a column with the elements of set X (applies only if data is
a data frame).}

\item{target}{a column with the elements of set Y (applies only if data is
a data frame).}

\item{value}{a column with the proximity values between the elements
of X or Y (applies only if data is a data frame).}

\item{avg_links}{average number of connections for the projection of X
(default set to 4)}

\item{tolerance}{tolerance for proximity variation on each iteration until
obtaining the desired average number of connections (default set to 0.05)}

\item{compute}{which projection to compute. By default is "both" (both
projections) but it can also be "source" or "target".}
