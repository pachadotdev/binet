\title{Complexity Measures}
\usage{
complexity_measures(balassa_index, method = "fitness", iterations = 20,
  extremality = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{balassa_index}{(Type: matrix or dgCMatrix) the output from
\code{balassa_index()}) or an equivalent arrangement.}

\item{method}{(Type: character) one of these methods: fitness,
reflections or eigenvalues. By default this is set to \code{"fitness"}.}

\item{iterations}{(Type: numeric) the number of iterations to use.
By default this is set to \code{20}.}

\item{extremality}{(Type: numeric) the parameter to use in the fitness
method. The other methods don't use this parameter.
By default this is set to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A list of four data frames. Two complexity indexes that are
ordering rankings for specialization and two aggregations (sums) of
the Balassa Index.
}
\description{
\code{complexity_measures()} computes different complexity
measures obtained from the Balassa Index or a binary (0/1) metric for a
bipartite relation between two disjoint sets X, the "source" or "from" side,
and Y, the "target" or "to" side.
}
\details{
The current implementation follows
\insertCite{measuringcomplexity2015}{binet} to obtain different metrics
that account for diversification in bipartite relations.
